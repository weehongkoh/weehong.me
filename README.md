# Vernon, Wee Hong KOH | Software Engineer

Welcome to my digital workshop! This repository contains the code behind my personal website, weehong.me: https://www.weehong.me.

I invite you to dive into my creative process and discover the technologies that bring my vision to life.

## Enthusiastic Technologies section:

### My toolkit for building the web

- Next.js 14
- Tailwind CSS
  - Typography
- Font Awesome
- React Markdown
  - RemarkGfm
  - RehypeSlug
  - RehypeToc

## How to use

1. `git clone git@github.com:weehongayden/weehong.me.git`
1. Create an `.env` file based on `.env.example` and fill in the desired value
1. `npm install' to install all dependencies
1. `npm run dev` to start hacking

### Notes

Please note that I'm using FontAwesome premium here, so the `npm install` failing to install is totally expected because the token is not provided in the `.npmrc` file.
Just remove the `@fortawesome/pro-duotone-svg-icons' from the package and replace all the free icons.

## A note of thanks

My design was heavily inspired by the fantastic work of https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io. Their repository served as a guiding star in the design of my site.

## Let's Connect!

I'm always looking to connect, collaborate, and share ideas with other passionate developers. Feel free to reach out!
